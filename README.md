# Panoply

A Personal Task Manager

A Task Manager app inspired by Things, but simpler and console based, with the
potential for expansion to a GUI later.

All tasks are saved as a CSV file; and the fields are used to compute what
tasks are overdue or are the closest up next; appropriate notifications are
then generated.

Run with 

*$ python panoply.py*

The panoply\_tasks.pan file contains all the tasks in a CSV format for now.
