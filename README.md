# PyPersonalTaskManager

A Task Manager app inspired by Things, but simpler and
console based.

All tasks are saved as a CSV file; and the fields are
used to compute what tasks are overdue or are the closest
up next; appropriate notifications are then generated.

Consult HOWTO for instructions about how to run and use.
